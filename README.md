# seaflow-filter

SeaFlow is a sheathless flow cytometer, an innovation that allows the instrument to run continuously at sea.  Position sensitive detectors (D1 and D2) along with forward scatter intensity are used to determine which particles are in focus within a virtual core of the stream ([Swalwell et al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.1002/cyto.a.20792)).  A custom analysis step (`filtration`) is used to identify the optimally positioned particles (OPP) within the virtual core ([Swalwell et al. 2011](https://doi.org/10.4319/lom.2011.9.466 )).

This repository contains the coordinates of 1 micron calibration beads (D1, D2 and forward scatter) for each cruise, which are used to calculate the filtration parameters for detecting Optimally Positioned particles. Red circle indicated optimal instrument settings.
